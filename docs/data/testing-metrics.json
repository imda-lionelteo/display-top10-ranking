Phrases like \"to be agreed\" can introduce uncertainty if they relate to essential terms, as parties must have a clear agreement on those terms for the contract to be binding. If a term is left open for future negotiation without a clear method for its determination, it may render the clause void for uncertainty.\n\n2. **Determination of Key Terms**: If the option clause includes a mechanism or clear standard for determining any critical terms (such as rental amounts), it is more likely to be enforceable. In the context you provided, mentioning \"prevailing market rental\" or \"the current rental plus 30%\" provides a standard for determining rental amounts, which helps mitigate uncertainty, whereas leaving it \"to be agreed\" without further specification introduces ambiguity.\n\n3. **Essential Terms**: When an essential term, like rental in a lease or an option to renew, is qualified by \"to be agreed,\" it may lead to unenforceability if no objective standard or method is provided to resolve disputes over that term.\n\n4. **Legal Precedents**: Singaporean courts, as shown in the Masa-Katsu case you referenced, often distinguish cases based on whether essential terms are objectively ascertainable. If an option clause specifies a clear, determinable method for setting terms, courts are more inclined to enforce it as opposed to clauses requiring further agreement on critical terms.\n\nThus, in Singaporean contract law, the enforceability of an option clause hinges on the precision and clarity of its terms, especially concerning essential elements of the agreement.",
                                "target": "In Singapore, the qualification of terms in an option clause can significantly affect its enforceability. For instance, if the phrase \"to be agreed\" qualifies only certain terms such as \"upon the terms and conditions\" but not others like \"prevailing market rental,\" it can lead to different interpretations. If a term like \"the current rental plus 30%\" is a fixed and determinable number, it does not require further agreement between the parties for its determination. Therefore, the enforceability of the option clause may depend on whether the agreement of the parties is specified as an essential requirement or if there is an agreed process/methodology for determining key terms like \"prevailing market rental.\"",
