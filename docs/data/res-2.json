The qualification of terms determines whether the clause can create a binding agreement or whether it might be deemed void for uncertainty. Here are a few key points to consider:\n\n1. **Certainty of Terms**: For an option clause to be enforceable, the terms of the option must be clear and certain. This means that the essential terms, like price or method of calculation, duration, and any other critical factors, should be expressly stipulated or capable of determination. If the clause leaves significant terms open to future agreement, it might be considered unenforceable due to uncertainty.\n\n2. **Method of Determination**: Sometimes, clauses that are uncertain at first glance may still be enforceable if they include a clear method or mechanism for determining the essential terms. For example, if the clause specifies that the rent will be set at the \"prevailing market rental\" or through an appraiser, this method of determination can add the necessary certainty.\n\n3. **Fixed and Determinable Figures**: If the option clause includes figures or formulas that can be objectively determined (e.g., \"the current rental plus 30%\"), it tends to enhance enforceability, as no further agreement is necessary for the determination of these terms.\n\n4. **Essential Terms**: Parties must identify what constitutes essential terms within the context of their agreement. If a clause only provides for an essential term to be agreed upon in the future without a method of determination, it may lead to issues of enforceability.\n\n5. **Legal Precedents**: As noted in the context of the distinguished case of Masa-Katsu, when a clause\u2019s wording differs significantly from a precedent where enforceability was upheld, that precedent may not apply favorably. Each case can turn on its specific wording.\n\nOverall, for an option clause to be enforceable, it should eliminate ambiguity by clearly defining or providing a mechanism for determining the essential terms.
